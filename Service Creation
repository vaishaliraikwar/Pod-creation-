Question 1: Create two pods named "blue" and "red" using nginx image. The "blue" pod should be exposed on port 80.
To create execute the following commands:

kubectl run blue --image=nginx --port=80
kubectl run red --image=nginx

Question 2: Create a nodeport service to expose the "blue" pod. The service should allow external access to the pod on the same port (port 80).
To create execute the following command:

kubectl expose pod blue --type=NodePort --port=80

Question 3: Create a clusterip service to expose the "red" pod. This service allows internal access within the Kubernetes cluster.
To create execute the following command:

kubectl expose pod red --type=ClusterIP --port=80

Question 4: Delete the nodeport service that was created for the "blue" pod.
To delete execute the following command:

kubectl delete service blue

Question 5: Recreate a nodeport service for the "blue" pod, this time using the following custom port settings:
Port: 8080
NodePort: 32711
TargetPort: 80
To recreate execute the following command:

Create a file named blue-service.yaml.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: blue-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: blue
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 32711
Apply the configuration using below command:
kubectl apply -f blue-service.yaml
