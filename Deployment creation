Deployment Creation- we are using deployment because we are facing problem with replicaset to update and rollout .In case of 
replicaset i we want to update version image it will delete all pod at same time then it occur application downtime and 
application will not accessible to user untill pod created.we can not switch with new version to old version



Question 1: Create a deployment named my-deploy with the image nginx.
To create a deployment named "my-deploy" with the nginx image, use the following command:
kubectl create deployment my-deploy --image=nginx

To check deploy use command
kubectl get all/kubectl get deploy(when we create deployment that time 3 things will create pod,replicaset,by default service account)
kubectl get deploy -o wide
If we want to check rollout history then we can use command 
kubectl rollout history deploy podname(mydeploy)

Question 2: Scale my-deploy to 3 replicas.
To scale the "my-deploy" deployment to 3 replicas, use the following command:

kubectl scale deployment my-deploy --replicas=3

Question 3: Replace the image in my-deploy from nginx to nginx:alpine.
To replace the image in the "my-deploy" deployment from "nginx" to "nginx:alpine", use the following command:

kubectl set image deployment my-deploy nginx=nginx:alpine
we can also use this one
kubectl get deploy mydeploy -o yaml > mydeploy.yaml
vim deploy.yaml[go to inside file and update image nginx to nginx:alpine]
then apply using command
kubectl apply -f podname.yaml
kbectl get deploy -o wide

Question 4: Scale down the replicas of my-deploy to 2.
To scale down the replicas of the "my-deploy" deployment to 2, use the following command:
kubectl scale deployment my-deploy --replicas=2

Question 5: Rollback to the previous version of my-deploy.
To rollback the "my-deploy" deployment to the previous version, use the following command:
kubectl rollout undo deployment my-deploy

Question 6: Delete the deployment, replicaset, and pod created by my-deploy.
